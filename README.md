This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Intro

In this project you will be taken through the basics of React, as we create a basic book-list app, starting with a single Book and working up to a Library.

## Setup

Clone this repo to your local machine, then in the project root folder, run `npm install`.

Start a local `create-react-app` server with `npm start`. Create-react-app should open a default project screen in your browser.

This project has a few branch checkpoints. During the lesson, there will be designated times to switch to the next branch checkpoint. This will allow us to explore the app in several stages of development.

Experimenting with the different checkpoints is encouraged, however it is recommended that you use `git switch -f branch-name` to easily discard these changes when switching to the next branch, to avoid any console errors.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
